# Homework 2: Upsampling

To run it:

    rosrun homework2 homework2_node src/homework2/src/view1.png src/homework2/src/disp1_small.png

if its to slow, make sure you are building for release and for cpp standard 14

    catkin_make -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=14 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE

You will have to look into code comments for details, im afraid :)
